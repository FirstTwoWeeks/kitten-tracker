# Kitten Tracker RuneLite plugin

This plugins allows you to track the age of your pet kitten and shows how long before your kitten will leave you <br> 
because of a lack of attention or when it is starving. It also shows notifications to remind you to feed your cat or <br>
give it attention.

Currently, the infoboxes can only display times up to 60 minutes. So for example, if the cat has still 2.5 hours left <br>
before being grown up, it will display 30:00. The hour digit is not displayed. This will be fixed in a later update
